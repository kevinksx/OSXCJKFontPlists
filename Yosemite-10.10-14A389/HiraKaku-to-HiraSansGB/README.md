This folder contains customized font fallback plist files of Yosemite since Developer Preview 5 till RTM build 14A389.<br>
They are customized for the following setting:<br>

Simplified Chinese GUI of OS X uses Hiragino Sans GB as its GUI font.<br>
Traditional Chinese GUI of OS X uses Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro as its GUI font.<br>

You should make sure:<br>
1. All of those fonts I mentioned above must be placed into "/System/Library/Fonts/" folder,<br>
2. All of those fonts I mentioned above should inherit permission settings from "/System/Library/Fonts/", NOT just simple 755.<br>

You should download files only if you know what they are and what they should be used for.<br>
